# Memory Game

Web based memory card game

## Installation

clone down to your local via github

```bash
npm install & npm start
```

## How to play

24 facedown cards
click a card, it flips over
if equal, they disappear
if unequal they flip back down

Game ends when no cards are left. 

## Technology used
```
Create react app, React, underscore library, jest and enzyme (unit testing)
```

## Notes

Things I would add with more time:

```
* An animation for the card flip
* Sounds when you win / match cards / or match wrong
* Instead of using numbers using images
* Better design of the cards
* A restart button once you've won the game
* Ability to increase the number of cards
* Helper function that allows random content for the cards
* (ensuring there are two of the same always)
* Accessibility - tabable and screen-readable
* Add proptypes for type safety
```
