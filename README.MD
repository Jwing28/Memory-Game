## Notes

Things I would add:

```
* An animation for the card flip
* Sounds when you win / match cards / or match wrong
* Instead of using numbers using images
* Better design of the cards
* A restart button once you've won the game
* Ability to increase the number of cards
* Helper function that allows random content for the cards
* (ensuring there are two of the same always)
* Accessibility - tabable and screen-readable
* Add proptypes for type safety
```
